                    Marvel's Spider-Man is a 2018 action-adventure game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.
                    Based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man, it is inspired by the long-running comic book mythology and adaptations in other media.
                    Spider-Man is an open-world action-adventure game set in the borough of Manhattan in a fictionalized version of modern-day New York City.
                    It is presented from a third-person perspective showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be rotated freely around it.
                    The primary playable character is the superhero Spider-Man, who can navigate the world by jumping, using his Web Shooters to fire webs that 
                    allows him to swing between buildings, running along walls, and automatically vaulting over obstacles. The character can precisely aim webs to pull himself towards specific points.
                    Physical objects are required to attach webs to for swinging, and momentum and speed of the swing can be controlled by releasing the web at specific points to gain height or move more quickly.
                    The game features an optional fast travel system that uses the New York City Subway system.

                    Red Dead Redemption 2 is a Western-themed action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. 
                    It was released on October 26, 2018, for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles. 
                    The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. 
                    The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern and Southern United States and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang. 
                    Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other enemies. 
                    The story also follows fellow gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption.
                    Red Dead Redemption 2's unexploited land makes up the largest portion of the game world, and features diverse landscapes with occasional travelers, bandits, and wildlife.
                    There are urban settlements in the game, ranging from farmhouses to towns and cities.
                    Horses are the main forms of transportation, of which there are various breeds, each with different attributes. 
                    The player must either train or tame a wild horse in order to use it, with the exception of stolen horses; however they must saddle a horse in order to acquire ownership over it. 
                    Increased use of a horse will begin a bonding process, which can be increased by cleaning and feeding it, and the player will acquire advantages as they ride their horse.[7] 
                    Stagecoaches and trains can also be used to travel. The player can hijack an incoming train or stagecoach by threatening the driver or passengers and then rob its contents or the passengers.
