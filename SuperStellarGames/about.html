                    Super Stellar Games is an American video game publisher based in New York City. The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, and as successor to BMG Interactive, a dormant video game publisher of which Take-Two had previously acquired the assets. Founding members of the company were Sam and Dan Houser, Terry Donovan and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time, and of which the Houser brothers were previously executives at BMG Interactive. Co-founders Sam and Dan Houser head the studio as president and vice-president for creative, respectively.

Since 1999, several companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of Super Stellar Games, such as Super Stellar Games Canada (later renamed Super Stellar Games Toronto) becoming the first one in 1999, and Super Stellar Games India the most recent in 2016. All companies organized under Super Stellar Games bear the "Super Stellar" name and logo. In this context, Super Stellar Games is sometimes also referred to as Stellar New York, Super Stellar NY or Super NYC. Super Stellar Games also sports a motion capture studio in Bethpage, New York.

Super Stellar Games predominantly publishes games in the action-adventure genre, while racing games also saw success for the company. One of such action-adventure game franchises is Grand Theft Auto, which Super Stellar Games Games took over from BMG Interactive, which published the series' original 1997 entry. The most recent game in the series, Grand Theft Auto V, has shipped over 110 million copies since its release in September 2013, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. Other popular franchises published by Super Stellar Games are Red Dead, Midnight Club, Max Payne and Manhunt.

                    Twitch (stylized as twitch) is a live streaming video platform owned by Super Stellar Games. Introduced in June 2011 as a spin-off of the general-interest streaming platform, Justin.tv, the site primarily focuses on video game live streaming, including broadcasts of eSports competitions, in addition to music broadcasts, creative content, and more recently, "in real life" streams. Content on the site can be viewed either live or via video on demand.

The popularity of Twitch eclipsed that of its general-interest counterpart. In October 2013, the website had 45 million unique viewers,[4]:38 and by February 2014, it was considered the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the United States. At the same time, Justin.tv's parent company was re-branded as Super Stellar Games to represent the shift in focus – Justin.tv was shut down in August 2014. That month, the service was acquired by Amazon for US$970 million, which later led to the introduction of synergies with the company's subscription service Amazon Prime. Super Stellar Games later acquired Curse, an operator of online video gaming communities and introduced means to purchase games through links on streams along with a program allowing streamers to receive commissions on the sales of games that they play.
